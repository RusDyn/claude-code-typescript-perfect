### Setting Up GitHub Integration

First, ensure GitHub MCP server is configured:

```bash
# If not already done
claude mcp add github -s user -- npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-github

# Set your GitHub token with appropriate permissions
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
# Token needs: repo, write:issues, read:project permissions
```

### Issue Scanning Workflow

Create `.claude/commands/scan-issues.md`:

```markdown
# Scan Codebase for Issues: $ARGUMENTS

## Scanning Process

1. **Code Quality Scan**
   Use filesystem to analyze code for:
   - TODO/FIXME/HACK comments
   - TypeScript `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error`
   - Disabled linting rules
   - Console.log statements
   - Hardcoded values that should be config
   - Missing error handling
   - Performance bottlenecks (O(n²) loops, etc.)

2. **Security Scan**
   Check for:
   - Hardcoded credentials or API keys
   - SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Missing input validation
   - Exposed sensitive data in logs
   - Missing authentication checks

3. **Technical Debt Scan**
   Identify:
   - Deprecated API usage
   - Missing tests for critical paths
   - Overly complex functions (high cyclomatic complexity)
   - Duplicate code blocks
   - Inconsistent patterns

## GitHub Issue Check

For each found issue:
1. Use github mcp to search existing issues
2. Check if issue already reported (by title/label match)
3. If exists: add comment with additional context
4. If new: create issue with proper formatting

## Issue Format Template

Title: [Type] Brief description - File:Line
Labels: bug/tech-debt/security/performance, priority-level
Body:
- **Location**: `src/path/to/file.ts:42`
- **Type**: [Issue category]
- **Description**: [What's wrong]
- **Impact**: [Who/what is affected]
- **Suggested Fix**: [Proposed solution]
- **Code Context**:
  ```typescript
  [relevant code snippet]
  ```
```

### Automated Issue Creation Pattern

**Example Claude Code session**:

```bash
claude --session=issue-scan

"Scan the entire codebase for issues and manage them in GitHub:

1. Use filesystem to scan all TypeScript files in src/
2. Identify issues following the scan-issues command patterns
3. Use github mcp to check existing issues with label 'automated-scan'
4. For new issues:
   - Create with appropriate labels and priority
   - Include code context and line numbers
   - Suggest fixes where possible
5. For existing issues:
   - Update with new occurrences
   - Bump priority if issue spread
6. Generate summary report of all issues found"
```

### Issue Templates for Common Problems

  file: string;
  line: number;
  type: 'TODO' | 'FIXME' | 'HACK' | 'XXX';
  message: string;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}

const scanPriority = (message: string): TodoItem['priority'] => {
  if (message.match(/urgent|critical|asap|security/i)) return 'high';
  if (message.match(/important|soon|performance/i)) return 'medium';
  return 'low';
};
```

**2. Technical Debt Tracker**:
```typescript
interface TechDebtItem {
  type: 'duplicate' | 'complexity' | 'deprecated' | 'pattern-violation';
  location: string;
  description: string;
  estimatedEffort: 'hours' | 'days' | 'weeks';
  businessImpact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}
```

```bash
# 30-minute focused sessions
claude --session=feature-auth-sprint1

# Sprint 1: Design (30 min)
"Design the authentication system:
1. Create all TypeScript types
2. Define API endpoints
3. Plan database schema
4. Identify edge cases"

# Break - Claude compacts automatically

# Sprint 2: Implementation (30 min)
"Implement the auth service following the design.
Use Result pattern for all operations."

# Sprint 3: Testing (30 min)
"Create comprehensive tests:
1. Unit tests for business logic
2. Integration tests for API
3. E2E test for login flow"
```

**3. The "Debug Detective" Pattern**
```bash
# Systematic debugging
claude --session=debug-payment-issue

"CONTEXT: Payment processing fails intermittently in production.
Error: 'Transaction timeout after 30s'

Use a systematic approach:
1. Use filesystem to review payment service code
2. Use postgres mcp to check database queries
3. Use github mcp to review recent changes
4. Apply sequential thinking for root cause analysis

Focus on race conditions and connection pooling."
```

### Cost Optimization Strategies

**Real Usage Data from Teams**:

| Team Size | Monthly Cost | Usage Pattern | Key Optimizations |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Solo Dev | $50-80 | 80% Sonnet, 20% Opus | Batch operations, clear CLAUDE.md |
| 5-Person Team | $200-400 | 70% Sonnet, 20% Flash, 10% Opus | Shared commands, model routing |
| 20-Person Team | $800-1500 | 60% Sonnet, 30% Flash, 10% Multi-model | Automation, strict conventions |

**Cost Reduction Techniques**:

1. **Batch Similar Operations**:
   ```
   ❌ "Fix this lint error" (×10 times)
   ✅ "Fix all lint errors in src/, group by type"
   ```

2. **Use Model Routing**:
   ```
   Simple formatting → Gemini Flash (cheapest)
   Standard coding → Claude Sonnet (balanced)
   Complex design → Claude Opus (when needed)
   Critical bugs → O3 via Zen MCP (worth it)
   ```

3. **Optimize Context**:
   ```
   # Add to CLAUDE.md
   ## Cost Optimization Rules
   - For formatting: Say "use quick mode"
   - For simple tasks: Say "be concise"
   - For complex tasks: Say "think step by step"
   ```

4. **Session Management**:
   ```bash
   # Clear context between unrelated tasks
   /clear
   
   # Compact when switching contexts
   /compact
   
   # Start new session for new features
   claude --new-session
   ```

### Performance Metrics from Real Teams

**Before Optimization**:
- 10-15 corrections per feature
- 2-3 hours per feature
- 60% test coverage
- $300/month for 5 developers

**After Implementing This Guide**:
- 2-3 corrections per feature
- 45-60 minutes per feature
- 85%+ test coverage
- $180/month for 5 developers

> **Smart Development**: Optimized Claude Code usage focuses on intelligence over effort, leading to significant productivity gains and cost reductions.

## 13. Emergency Procedures

> **Why this matters**: When production is down, you need Claude Code to help immediately without lengthy explanations.

### Production Incident Template

### Production Incident Template

🆘 **Template**: [incident-template.md](./emergency/incident-template.md)

**Template Sections:**
- Current status tracking (severity, impact, symptoms)
- Step-by-step immediate actions
- Available emergency tools and commands
- Clear DO NOT guidelines

### Quick Incident Response

```bash
# Start incident response
claude --session=incident-$(date +%s)

# Paste the incident template and add details
"[Paste incident.md content]

SPECIFIC ISSUE: API returning 500 errors
Started: 10 minutes ago
Error rate: 85% of requests

Help me:
1. Identify likely causes
2. Create immediate mitigation
3. Build emergency fix"
```

### Common Emergency Patterns

**1. Database Performance Crisis**:
```
"Production database CPU at 100%. Queries timing out.
Use postgres mcp to:
1. Find slow queries
2. Identify missing indexes
3. Create emergency optimization
Do not modify schema - only add indexes."
```

**2. Memory Leak**:
```
"Node process memory growing unbounded.
Using filesystem, check for:
1. Event listener leaks
2. Uncleared intervals/timeouts
3. Growing arrays/maps
4. Circular references
Focus on changes in last 24 hours."
```

**3. Third-Party Service Down**:
```
"Payment provider API returning 503.
Need immediate mitigation:
1. Implement circuit breaker
2. Add fallback queue
3. Create user-friendly error state
4. Set up retry mechanism"
```

### Post-Incident Review Template

📋 **Template**: [post-incident-review.md](./emergency/post-incident-review.md)

**Review Components:**
- Timeline tracking (detection to resolution)
- Root cause analysis
- Contributing factors identification
- Success/failure analysis
- Actionable improvement items

> **Emergency Response**: Documented incident procedures with Claude Code integration dramatically reduce resolution times from hours to minutes.
