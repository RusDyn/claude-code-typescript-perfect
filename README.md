- **Common Pitfalls**: DO NOT list with specific anti-patterns to avoid

---

## 4. Context Priming: Reduce Errors and Duplicates

> **Key Insight**: Most Claude Code errors stem from insufficient context. This section shows you how to provide context that prevents duplicate code, overengineering, and misaligned solutions.

### Essential Context Elements

Beyond the basic CLAUDE.md, include these critical elements to reduce errors:

#### Project Standards Section

```markdown
## Code Quality Standards

### Simplicity First
- Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements
- Avoid premature optimization or overengineering
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use existing patterns before creating new ones

### Duplication Prevention
- Always check existing implementations before creating new ones
- Reuse existing utilities, types, and patterns
- Extract common patterns into shared utilities only when used 3+ times
- Document existing solutions in this file for Claude reference

### Complexity Guidelines
- Functions should have single responsibility
- Avoid deeply nested conditionals (max 3 levels)
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Break complex functions into smaller, focused ones
```

#### Architecture Context

```markdown
## Current Architecture Patterns

### Data Flow
- [Describe your state management approach]
- [Document data fetching patterns]
- [Explain error handling flow]

### Existing Components/Modules
- Authentication: `src/auth/` - JWT-based with refresh tokens
- API Layer: `src/api/` - Axios with interceptors for error handling
- Utilities: `src/utils/` - Common helpers for [specific functions]
- Types: `src/types/` - Shared TypeScript definitions

### Before Adding New Code
1. Check if similar functionality exists in the codebase
2. Verify the new feature aligns with existing patterns
3. Consider extending existing components rather than creating new ones
```

#### Development Workflow Context

```markdown
## Development Standards

### Testing Requirements
- All new functions must have unit tests
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for user-facing features
- Run `npm test` before any commit

### Performance Standards
- Bundle size budget: [specific numbers]
- Build time targets: [specific times]
- Core Web Vitals targets: [specific metrics]

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Follows existing patterns
- [ ] Has appropriate tests
- [ ] Includes JSDoc comments
- [ ] No duplicate functionality
- [ ] Handles errors appropriately
```

## 5. Ultra-Strict TypeScript: Eliminate Bug Categories


### The Ultimate tsconfig.json

Our ultra-strict TypeScript configuration eliminates entire categories of runtime errors.

📋 **Configuration File**: [tsconfig.json](./configs/tsconfig.json)

**Key Features:**
- **Maximum Strictness**: `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `strictNullChecks`
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES2022 target with full Node.js support
- **Enhanced Safety**: No unused variables, unreachable code, or implicit returns
- **Path Mapping**: Clean imports with `@/` aliases for better Claude Code understanding
- **Development Optimized**: Source maps, incremental compilation, and JSDoc preservation


---

## 6. ESLint Configuration: Enforce Best Practices Automatically

> **Why this matters**: ESLint acts as Claude Code's quality control system. When Claude Code suggests changes, ESLint immediately catches style inconsistencies, potential bugs, and anti-patterns. This creates a feedback loop that makes Claude Code's suggestions more accurate over time.

### The "Zero-Tolerance" ESLint Config

Our comprehensive ESLint configuration enforces best practices automatically.

🔧 **Configuration File**: [eslint.config.js](./configs/eslint.config.js)

**Key Features:**
- **Strict TypeScript Rules**: Explicit return types, no `any`, unsafe operation prevention
- **Modern JavaScript**: Unicorn plugin for ES2022+ patterns
- **Code Quality**: SonarJS for complexity and maintainability
- **Security**: Built-in security vulnerability detection
- **Claude Code Sync**: Naming conventions and patterns that Claude understands best
- **Smart Test Handling**: Relaxed rules for test files where appropriate


---

## 7. Git Hooks: Never Commit Bad Code

> **Why this matters**: Git hooks are automated quality gates that run before commits. They catch issues Claude Code might miss and prevent broken code from entering your repository. This is critical because Claude Code works best when it can trust that existing code follows quality standards.

> **What are Git hooks?**: Automated scripts that run at specific Git events (like before commits). Think of them as automatic code review that happens instantly.

### Complete Git Hooks Setup

```bash
# Install husky and lint-staged
npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged

# Initialize husky
npx husky init

# Install commit message linter
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
```

### Intelligent lint-staged Configuration

> **What is lint-staged?**: A tool that runs quality checks only on files you're about to commit, making commits fast while maintaining quality. Instead of checking your entire project, it only checks the files you changed.

🔧 **Configuration File**: [lint-staged.config.js](./configs/lint-staged.config.js)

**Key Features:**
- **Full TypeScript Validation**: Type checks entire project to catch cross-file issues
- **Smart Test Running**: Automatically runs tests for modified files only
- **Multi-format Support**: Handles TypeScript, JSON, Markdown, and YAML files
- **Package.json Guards**: Runs security audit and type checking on dependency changes

**Pre-commit Hook**: [pre-commit](./husky/pre-commit) - Automated quality checks

**Commit Standards**: [commitlint.config.js](./configs/commitlint.config.js) - Conventional commit format

---

## 8. Custom Claude Commands: Reusable Workflows

> **Why this matters**: Custom commands give Claude Code reusable workflows for common tasks. Instead of re-explaining your debugging process every time, you can run `/debug` and Claude Code instantly knows your preferred systematic approach. This dramatically reduces setup time and ensures consistent quality.

> **What are custom commands?**: Markdown files containing detailed instructions that Claude Code follows when you type `/command-name`. They're like having expert teammates available instantly.

### Setting Up Custom Commands

Create `.claude/commands/` directory structure:

```bash
.claude/
├── commands/
│   ├── feature.md      # Create new features
│   ├── debug.md        # Systematic debugging
│   ├── review.md       # Code review checklist
│   ├── refactor.md     # Safe refactoring
│   └── performance.md  # Performance optimization
└── context/
    └── architecture.md # Additional context files
```

### Command Examples

🚀 **Feature Development**: [feature.md](./commands/feature.md)
🐛 **Debugging**: [debug.md](./commands/debug.md)
⚡ **Performance**: [performance.md](./commands/performance.md)
🔍 **Issue Scanning**: [scan-issues.md](./commands/scan-issues.md)
🛠️ **Issue Fixing**: [fix-issue.md](./commands/fix-issue.md)
🆘 **Incidents**: [incident.md](./commands/incident.md)
📋 **Post-Incident**: [post-incident.md](./commands/post-incident.md)

---

## 9. MCP Servers: External Tool Integration

> **Why this matters**: MCP servers let Claude Code access external tools like GitHub, databases, and APIs directly. This means Claude Code can review pull requests, check database schemas, and interact with your development tools without you manually copying information back and forth.

### Essential Setup (Choose What You Need)

**GitHub Integration** (for PR reviews, issue management):
```bash
# 1. Get a GitHub token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# 2. Give it repo access (read permissions minimum)
# 3. Set up the integration:
claude mcp add github -s user -- npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

**Database Access** (optional, for schema checks):
```bash
# Only if you need Claude Code to check database schemas
claude mcp add postgres -s user -- npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres
# You'll need to provide connection details when asked
```

### Practical Usage Examples

**GitHub Integration:**
```
"Use GitHub MCP to review PR #123 for TypeScript issues and missing tests"
"Check if there are any open issues related to authentication"
"Create a new issue for the login bug we just found"
```

**Database Integration:**
```
"Use postgres MCP to check the current user table schema"
"Verify the notifications table exists before I add the feature"
```

### Quick Start Recommendation
**Start with GitHub MCP only** - it's the most useful for daily development. Add database integration later if needed.

## 10. Testing Strategy: Confidence Through Automation

> **Why this matters**: Tests give Claude Code confidence to refactor and modify your code. When Claude Code sees comprehensive tests, it can make bolder improvements knowing that tests will catch any regressions.

### Testing Priority for Beginners

**Start with these in order:**
1. **Unit tests** - Test individual functions (80% of your tests should be here)
2. **Integration tests** - Test API endpoints and database interactions
3. **E2E tests** - Test complete user workflows (only for critical paths)

### Testing Setup

🧪 **Configuration**: [vitest.config.ts](./configs/vitest.config.ts)

```bash
npm install --save-dev vitest @vitest/coverage-v8 @testing-library/react playwright
```

### Test Examples

🧪 **Unit Tests**: [unit-test.ts](./test-patterns/unit-test.ts)
🔗 **Integration Tests**: [integration-test.ts](./test-patterns/integration-test.ts)
🎭 **E2E Tests**: [e2e-test.ts](./test-patterns/e2e-test.ts)

## 11. Standard TypeScript Patterns for Claude Code

> **Why this matters**: Claude Code works best with familiar, standard TypeScript patterns. Complex custom patterns can confuse the AI and slow down development.

### Battle-Tested Patterns Claude Code Recognizes

**Standard Error Handling**:
```typescript
// Async/await with try-catch (Claude Code's preferred pattern)
async function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
  try {
    const response = await api.get(`/users/${id}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch user:', error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

**TypeScript Utility Types**:
```typescript
// Use built-in utility types Claude Code understands perfectly
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user';
}

type CreateUserRequest = Omit<User, 'id'>;
type UpdateUserRequest = Partial<Pick<User, 'name' | 'email'>>;
type UserPublicInfo = Pick<User, 'id' | 'name'>;
```

**Standard Interface Patterns**:
```typescript
// Simple, predictable interfaces Claude Code handles well
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  success: boolean;
  message?: string;
}

interface PaginatedResponse<T> extends ApiResponse<T[]> {
  total: number;
  page: number;
  limit: number;
}
```

**Function Overloading (when needed)**:
```typescript
// Clear function signatures Claude Code can work with
function formatDate(date: Date): string;
function formatDate(date: string): string;
function formatDate(date: Date | string): string {
  const d = typeof date === 'string' ? new Date(date) : date;
  return d.toISOString().split('T')[0];
}
```

---

## 12. Workflow Optimization: Prevent Overcomplex Code

> **Problem**: Claude Code can sometimes over-engineer solutions or create unnecessarily complex code when given vague instructions.

### Structured Prompting Techniques

#### The "Simplest First" Pattern

Always start requests with explicit simplicity constraints:

```
"Create a simple user authentication system. Requirements:
- Use existing patterns from src/auth/
- Minimal dependencies 
- No more than 3 new files
- Reuse existing validation utilities
- Test with existing test patterns"
```

#### The "Context-First" Pattern

Begin complex requests by having Claude analyze existing code:

```
"Before implementing the notification system:
1. First analyze existing notification patterns in the codebase
2. Identify reusable components and utilities  
3. Propose the simplest approach that fits our architecture
4. Then implement following our established patterns"
```

### Custom Commands for Code Quality

Add these commands to your `.claude/commands/` directory:

#### `/simplify` Command

🔧 **Command File**: [simplify.md](./commands/simplify.md)

Simplifies overly complex code while maintaining functionality. Focuses on reducing nesting, extracting reusable functions, and eliminating unnecessary abstractions.

#### `/check-duplicates` Command

🔍 **Command File**: [check-duplicates.md](./commands/check-duplicates.md)

Analyzes the codebase for duplicate or similar functionality. Provides consolidation recommendations with impact analysis.

### Quality Gates Integration

Update your git hooks to include simplicity checks:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Pre-commit hook additions

# Check for complex functions
echo "Checking for overly complex functions..."
npx eslint --ext .ts,.js src/ --rule "complexity: [2, 10]" --quiet

# Check for duplicate code
echo "Checking for duplicate code patterns..."
npx jscpd src/ --threshold 3 --reporters console

# Verify test coverage for new code
echo "Verifying test coverage..."
npm run test:coverage -- --reporter=text-summary
```

---

## 13. Emergency Procedures

> **What are emergency procedures?**: Pre-defined workflows for when your application breaks in production. These commands give Claude Code the context and steps to help you respond quickly and systematically to incidents.

### Emergency Response Commands

For production incidents, use these Claude commands for immediate assistance:

**`/incident`** - Activates incident response mode with:
- Immediate situation assessment
- Systematic mitigation guidance
- Available emergency commands
- Root cause investigation
- Fix implementation support

**`/post-incident`** - Creates comprehensive post-incident reviews with:
- Timeline reconstruction
- Impact analysis and quantification
- Root cause analysis (5 Whys technique)
- Action items with owners
- Lessons learned documentation

### Quick Response

```bash
claude /incident
"API returning 500 errors, started 10 minutes ago, 85% error rate"
```
