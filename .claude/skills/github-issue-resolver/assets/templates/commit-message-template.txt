# Example:
# fix(auth): Prevent crash on null email input
#
# The authentication function previously crashed when receiving null
# or undefined email values. This adds proper validation to check
# for null/undefined before processing.
#
# Also improved error messages to be more descriptive for debugging.
#
# Fixes #123

# ================== Guidelines ==================

# Types:
#   feat:     New feature
#   fix:      Bug fix
#   docs:     Documentation only
#   style:    Code style (formatting, no logic change)
#   refactor: Code restructuring (no behavior change)
#   perf:     Performance improvement

#   ci:       CI/CD changes

# Subject Line (first line):
#   - 50 characters or less
#   - Imperative mood ("Add" not "Added" or "Adds")
#   - No period at end
#   - Capitalize first letter
#   - Describe what this commit does

# Body (optional, but recommended):
#   - Wrap at 72 characters
#   - Explain WHAT and WHY, not HOW
#   - Separate from subject with blank line
#   - Can have multiple paragraphs

# Footer (optional):
#   - Reference issues: Fixes #123, Closes #456, Refs #789
#   - Breaking changes: BREAKING CHANGE: description
#   - Co-authors: Co-authored-by: Name <email>

# ================== Good Examples ==================

# Bug Fix:
# fix: Handle special characters in email validation
#
# Previous implementation failed with special characters like '+' or '='
# in email addresses. Updated the regex pattern to properly handle these
# characters according to RFC 5322.
#
# Fixes #123

# Feature:
# feat(api): Add pagination to user list endpoint
#
# Implements offset-based pagination with configurable page size.
# Default page size is 20, maximum is 100.
#
# Returns pagination metadata in response headers:
# - X-Total-Count: Total number of items
# - X-Page-Size: Items per page
# - X-Page-Number: Current page
#
# Fixes #456

# Breaking Change:
# feat!: Change user ID format from integer to UUID
#
# BREAKING CHANGE: User IDs are now UUIDs instead of integers.
# Clients must update API calls to use UUID format.
#
# Migration guide added to docs/migration/v2-to-v3.md
#
# Fixes #789

# Documentation:
# docs: Add examples for custom authentication
#
# Added code examples showing:
# - How to implement custom auth provider
# - How to configure multiple auth methods
# - Common troubleshooting scenarios
#
# Closes #101

# Refactoring:
# refactor(db): Extract query builders to separate module
#
# Moves query building logic from models to dedicated query builder
# classes. No functional changes, just better code organization.
#
# Makes it easier to add custom queries and maintain existing ones.

# ================== Bad Examples (Don't Do This) ==================

# Too vague:
# fix: bug fix

# Not imperative:
# fixed the authentication bug

# Too long subject:
# fix: Fixed the bug where authentication fails when email contains special characters like plus signs

# No explanation:
# update code

# Unrelated changes:
# fix: auth bug, update readme, refactor utils

# Wrong format:
# Fixed Bug.
